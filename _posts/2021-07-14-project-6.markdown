description: "I went to bed, after completing the blockbuster eroge game that had become a trending topic in the past few days. When I woke up, I noticed something was different. Somehow and for some reason I got reincarnated in the initial stage of the same game that I was playing before.
The most concerning part was my character. I was playing the role of a character who challenges the hero and gets defeated. In addition, all the routes of this particular character have been confirmed death.
I got reincarnated as an underdog, and the situation is even worse, because someone has already defeated me in a duel. I can't escape death anymore.
But I wonâ€™t give up. I have the knowledge of the eroge game that I had cleared in my previous life. I will make full use of it and try to survive.
This is a story about our hero who got reincarnated as an eroge underdog character, and trying his hard to survive.
